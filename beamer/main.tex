1. A laminate is an assembly of layers of composite materials which can be
joined to provide required engineering properties.  Figure 1 is the schematic of
a laminate. 
2. For each layer, its properies is determined by several variables: the
thickness of the layer, the fiber orientation, and engineering properites of the
material. The properitis of a laminate is determined by the combination of these
layers.  

A question arises from this is how to determine the strength of a laminate.

\note{We can use these formulas to check whether a laminate

above-mentioned classical lamination thoery.

These equations are called failure theory, Here we adopt two different failure theories, one is
Tsai-wu, and the other is Maximum Stress. The reason is that they have different
failure surface.

we can predict the strengh of a laminate according to classical lamination
theory and failure theory.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Target: strength
				\item Constraints: weight cost etc.
				\item Variable: ply directiron, number of plies, material
			\end{itemize}

\note{
1. But how to design it.
2. In practice, we need to tailor the structure of a laminate 
material to satisfy engineering requirements. such as the weight and cost.  
3. the layout of this  sequence is determined by several variables, the ply
thickness, the number of layers, the ply oritentation. And all these variables
are discrete in practice.  So in nature the design of laminated composite
material is a constrained optimization with discrete variables.

				\item  3. reformulate the objective functions as

\note{One of the most natural way to solve this problem is to adopt genetic
algorithm, because it doesn't require the variable to be continuous. 
This classical method works in the following step 
1. formulate the objective function. 
2. append all the constraints to the objective function as punishment items
3. reformulate the objective function.
In this formula, the coefficient c subscript 1 is coefficient whose value is from 0 to 1.

The drawback of this method is that genetic algorithm is proposed for unconstrained problem, you have to reformulate the objective function.

\note{The general flowchart of the proposed genetic algorithm is as shown in
	Fig4. 
	Compared with the classical GA, there are two differences:
	
	1. first, classify the population into three different groups according to the
	constraints, active group, potential group and proper group. we will explain
	these terminology later.
	2. second, the mutation operator for active group and potential, proper
	group is different. For the active group, the mutation follows the
	traditional pattern; we will adopt new mutation technique for the potential
	and proper group.
 }

\begin{frame}{Definition \hfill}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An individual is active if its constraint value is far smaller than the
				threshold. A group is consist of
				active individuals are called as active group.
			\item An individual is potential if its constraint value is  close but smaller than the
				thresold. The corresponding group is
				refered as potential group.
			\item An individual is proper if it satisfy all the constraints. Its
				counterpart group is written as proper group.
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{Here are some definition and terminology:
The role of different group is different. The role of active group is to
maintain the diversity of the mating pool. The role of potential group is to
find possible solutions. In the proper group, they are  the individual that we want.}

		$\text{md} = [CT_1, \cdots, CT_{n-1}, CT_n] -  [ICV_1, \cdots, ICV_{n-1},

		\begin{itemize}
			\item  md means mutation direction.
			\item  $CT_i$ denotes the i-th constraint, such as weight, strength ratio.
			\item  $ICV_i$ denotes individual's i-th constraint value, such as,  weight, strength ratio 
				of current individual.
		\end{itemize}

    \end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\note{The second technique in the proposed genetic algorithm is self-adaptive mutation
	operator, which means it can adjust the mutation according to the
	constraint value.  In this formula, the CTn represents threshold, ICVn
	denotes the corresponding individual's constraint value.  We get a mutation
	vector from this formula, which can be used to direct the mutation of the
chromosome.}

					  LMC*[\sum_{i=1}^{N}{md_i}, 0] & \text{if $\sum_{i=1}^{N}{md_i} < 0$} \\

				LMC stands for length mutation coefficient, it's a positive integer.
			\item $P(AM)$ = 
				\[
				  \begin{cases}
					0.5, \text{ AM = }[0,AMC \sum_{i=1}^{N}{(|CT_i-CV_i|)}] \\ 
					0.5, \text{ AM = }[ AMC \sum_{i=1}^{N}{(-|CT_i-CV_i|)},0]
				  \end{cases}
				\] \\
				AMC stands for angle mutation coefficient.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}


\note{The self-adaptive mutation is consist of two parts: length mutation and angle mutation.
	for the length mutation, we increase the length of the chromosome when the
	sum of entries in the mutation is great than zero,  this is because the
	bigger the length is, the more possible it satisfy the constraint. 
	For the angle mutation, we just
	random change the angels with probability 0.5, because there is no clear
	relation between the ply oritentation and the strength.

\note{
		 To overcome the drawback of traditional genetic algorithm in the
			design of laminated sequence, and propose a new genetic algorithm
			framework with two techniques for solving constrained problem
			optimization.
		 To improve the performance and efficient of the design laminate sequence, compared with the other optimization method.
		 To obtain feasible solutions for single-constrained or multiple constrained design of laminate sequence. 

The first is overcome the drawback of traditional genetic algorithm in the
design of a laminate.
The second is to improve the performance and efficient of the design of a
laminate.
The third is to find feasible solutions for single-constrained and multiple
constrained problem.

Therefore, we proposed a new genetic algorithm with two Techniques, the
first is mating pool classification, and the second is self-adaptive mutation
operator. The advantage of this method is that We don't need to reformulate the
objective function.}

}


\note{We have three conclusions from this chapter:
	The first is that the proposed genetic algorithm can be used to guide the
	design of laminated structure with one or multiple constraints without
	modifying the objective function.
	The second is mating pool classification and self-adaptive mutation play an
	important role during the optimization process, the length muation
	coefficient can be used to control the converge speed of this algorithm.
	This method will have a fine-grained search with a small length mutation
	coefficient.

	The proposed algorithm outperformed or provided an alternative feasible
	solution compared with other literature.  The proposed genetic algorithm can
	be used to guide the design of laminated structure with one or multiple
	constraints without modifying the objective function.  The simulation
	results have shown that the two technique: mating pool classification and
	self-adaptive mutation play an important role during the optimization
	process, the length muation coefficient can be used to control the converge
	speed of this algorithm.  The proposed algorithm is able to outperform or
	provide an alternative solution compared with other literature.

Another problems arises from a laminate is the the strength prediction.
	The traditional way of doing this follows a two-step precedure: first,
	calculate the stress and strain within the laminated composite material by

\note{
We also trained a neural network which has the same architecture as the neural
network that we obtained from genetic algorithm. The only difference is that
neurons in the hidden layer are fully connected with the inputs.

\note{
		 Neural network can be adopted to predict the strength of laminated composite material instead of the classical analytical approach.
		 GA-based neural network outperformed fully-connected neural network in the strength prediction.

	The summary of this chapter is as following:
		Neural network can be adopted to predict the strength of laminated composite material instead of the classical analytical approach.
		GA-based neural network outperformed fully-connected neural network in the strength prediction.
