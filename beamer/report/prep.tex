	1. Hello, everyone,  welcome to my report. Thank you for
	taking your time out and being here today. 
	2. My name is zhang, I got my phd from kyoto institute of technology in Japan last month. My
	major is advanced fibro science, in which I focuse on the application of
	compution science in textile industry.
	3. I am here to tell the result of my research over the last few years.
Without any further ado, let's begin.  }

\note{ 
1. Composite material gains more and more influence in commerical industry
because of its excellant mechanic performance in stiffness, stength etc., over
conventional materials.  

2. Here are two examples of the use of them, the first one
is used in the space shuttle, for the main body of the space shuttle, down the
red arrow, the main reason it was chosen for weight saving and for small
mechanical and thermal deflections. 

3. The second example is the use in the air plane,  which is because of its high
mechanical strength, heat resistant, and very low smoke evolution in a smoke.}

\note{ 
1. A laminate is an assembly of layers of composite materials which can be
joined to provide required engineering properties.  Figure 1 is the schematic of
a laminate. 
2. For each layer, its properies is determined by several variables: the
thickness of the layer, the fiber orientation, and engineering properites of the
material. The properitis of a laminate is determined by the combination of these
layers.  

A question arises from this is how to determine the strength of a laminate.

above-mentioned classical lamination thoery.

These equations are called failure theory, Here we adopt two different failure theories, one is
Tsai-wu, and the other is Maximum Stress. The reason is that they have different
failure surface.

we can predict the strengh of a laminate according to classical lamination
theory and failure theory.

\begin{frame}{But, How to Design a Laminate?}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Target: strength
				\item Constraints: weight cost etc.
				\item Variable: ply directiron, number of plies, material
			\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{
1. But how to design it.
2. In practice, we need to tailor the structure of a laminate 
material to satisfy engineering requirements. such as the weight and cost.  
3. the layout of this  sequence is determined by several variables, the ply
thickness, the number of layers, the ply oritentation. And all these variables
are discrete in practice.  So in nature the design of laminated composite
material is a constrained optimization with discrete variables.

\note{One of the most natural way to solve this problem is to adopt genetic
algorithm, because it doesn't require the variable to be continuous. 
This classical method works in the following step 
1. formulate the objective function. 
2. append all the constraints to the objective function as punishment items
3. reformulate the objective function.
In this formula, the coefficient c subscript 1 is coefficient whose value is from 0 to 1.

The drawback of this method is that genetic algorithm is proposed for unconstrained problem, you have to reformulate the objective function.

\note{The general flowchart of the proposed genetic algorithm is as shown in
	Fig4. 
	Compared with the classical GA, there are two differences:
	
	1. first, classify the population into three different groups according to the
	constraints, active group, potential group and proper group. we will explain
	these terminology later.
	2. second, the mutation operator for active group and potential, proper
	group is different. For the active group, the mutation follows the
	traditional pattern; we will adopt new mutation technique for the potential
	and proper group.

\begin{frame}{Definition \hfill}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An individual is active if its constraint value is far smaller than the
				threshold. A group is consist of
				active individuals are called as active group.
			\item An individual is potential if its constraint value is  close but smaller than the
				thresold. The corresponding group is
				refered as potential group.
			\item An individual is proper if it satisfy all the constraints. Its
				counterpart group is written as proper group.
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{Here are some definition and terminology:
The role of different group is different. The role of active group is to
maintain the diversity of the mating pool. The role of potential group is to
find possible solutions. In the proper group, they are  the individual that we want.}

\note{The second technique in the proposed genetic algorithm is self-adaptive mutation
	operator, which means it can adjust the mutation according to the
	constraint value.  In this formula, the CTn represents threshold, ICVn
	denotes the corresponding individual's constraint value.  We get a mutation
	vector from this formula, which can be used to direct the mutation of the
chromosome.}

\note{The self-adaptive mutation is consist of two parts: length mutation and angle mutation.
	for the length mutation, we increase the length of the chromosome when the
	sum of entries in the mutation is great than zero,  this is because the
	bigger the length is, the more possible it satisfy the constraint. 
	For the angle mutation, we just
	random change the angels with probability 0.5, because there is no clear
	relation between the ply oritentation and the strength.

that the strength ratio must greater than 2.}
\note{In this figure, we present the crossover, mutation operator of the proposed

	generations, and the dotted line denotes its corresponding strength ratio.
	If no individuals in the population satisfy the constraint, the best individual
	is the one with the biggest strength ratio; if not, the best individual is the
	one with the biggest fitness.
	As you can see this process can be divided into two process by this vertical
	line, before it no individual satifies the consraint. During this stage,
	The solid curve goes up and down at some points, however the corresponding
	strength ratio is keep increasing.
	During the second stage, the strength ratio curves is always big than the
	thresold, the fitness curves is keep increasing.
	This is because we have to method to adjust the strength ratio of a

Another problems arises from a laminate is the the strength prediction.

	The traditional way of doing this follows a two-step precedure: first,

\note{Since it is impossible to obtain enough training data from experiment,
therefore, we generate the training data by use of classical lamination theory and
failure theory. Table 11 shows part of our training data, in which the load
varys from -200 to 200 MP a for every component. the ply orientation varies
from -90 to 90. We use three different composite materail. The training data is
randomly sampled from this space. After obtain the two ouputs, we need
normalize the training data for the learning of the neural network.}

\note{
We also trained a neural network which has the same architecture as the neural
network that we obtained from genetic algorithm. The only difference is that
neurons in the hidden layer are fully connected with the inputs.

	The summary of this chapter is as following:
		Neural network can be adopted to predict the strength of laminated composite material instead of the classical analytical approach.
		GA-based neural network outperformed fully-connected neural network in the strength prediction.

\begin{frame}{Conclusion: \hfill }
		This thesis focused on two core aspects of laminated
		composite material: the design of laminate sequence and strength
		prediction of the laminated structure.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The proposed new genetic algorithm can be adopted to guide
				the constrained design of laminate sequence.  
			\item It was demonstrated that the artificial neural network could
				predict the strength of laminate structure instead of the
				complicated mathematical model.
		\end{itemize}
