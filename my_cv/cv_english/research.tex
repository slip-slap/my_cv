%		\item { The multiple constrained optimization based on a variant of
%				genetic algorithm(GA). GA is an efficient and robust algorithm
%				to solve the optimization problem in terms of discrete
%				variables.  However, intially GA was proposed for unconstrained
%				problem, to solve constrained problem, we have to reformulate
%				the objective function, in which append the constraints to the
%%				objective function as punishment items. To overcome the
 %   			inherient drawback, we propose a new genetic algorithm with two
 %   			techniques: mating pool classification and self-adaptive
 %   			mutaiton.  Then we adopt this new genetic algorithm to guide the
 %   			design of a laminate under single or multiple constraints.}

 %%   	\item { The topology design of an artifical neural network(ANN) based on
  %  			genetic algorithm. Artifical neural networks are widely used for
  %  			various scenarios, such as prediction, classification,
  %  			optimization, in which the topology of an ANN plays a critical
  %  			role of the performance. We propose a three-layer ANN model, in
  %  			which the design variables are the number of neurons in the
  %%  			hidden layer, the active function, and the connection
   % 			relationship. Genetic algorithm is adopted to guide the search
   % 			process, and the one with best performance is used to predict
   % 			the strength of angle ply laminate. The advantage of the method
   % 			is to reduce the computaiton cost and simplify the
   % 			calculation process, compared with the tradional complicated
   % 			mathematical model.}

				The separation of connected curve based on convex hull algorithm
				and the elliptic curve fitting based on fourier transforamtion. 
				Convex hull algorithm is used to obtain the smallest convex
				polygon which encloses a set of points. Fourier transforamtion
				can be used to remove noises on a curve. The human body data
				points can be obtained through a three-dimensional scan device, 
				and the shape of transverse section of human body depends on the
				the cutting point. For the transverse section at the armpit, the
				shape of the cross section is a joint curve of three circles. We
				can use convex hull algorithm to find the separtion point. For
				the cross section at the waist, the corresponding shape is a
				circle with noises, and fourier transforamtion can remove the
				noise on the curve.
