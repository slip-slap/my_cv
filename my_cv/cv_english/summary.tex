\begin{cvparagraph}
I stepped into the door to the computer science under my master professor lead.
From then, programming and mathematics have become the indispensable part of my
research life. During the last six academaic years, I focused on the application
and optimization of art-of-the-state model and algorithm on the textile
engineering and composite material domain. I have used different programming
language such as matlab, java, python, and C++. To better learning and review, I
upload all my notes to my personal github website. In the future, my interest is
data analysis, prediction and artificial intelligence.
