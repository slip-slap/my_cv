\begin{cvparagraph}
I stepped into the door to the computer science under my master professor's
lead. Since then, programming and mathematics have become an indispensable part
of my research life. For the last six academic years, I have focused on the
applications of art‐of‐the‐state models and algorithms in the textile
engineering and composite material domain. I have used different programming
languages such as Matlab, java, python, and C++. To better learn and review, I
upload all my notes to the GitHub website. My interest is in data analysis,
prediction, and artificial intelligence in the future.
